# Singuist

## Minimum Viable Product

Singuist is a web app inspired by Genius, using a Ruby on Rails
backend and a React/Redux frontend. By the end of week 9, this app
will satisfy the following with bug-free navigation, adequate seeding,
and sufficient CSS styling:

- Hosting on Heroku
- Account creation, login, and guest/demo login
- Tracks
- Annotations on specified segments of a track's lyrics
- Comments on annotations
- Voting on annotations and comments
- Production README

## Implementation Timeline
### Phase 1: Backend setup and Frontend user authentication (2 days)
**objective:** Working Rails project with frontend authentication

### Phase 2: Track model, API, and components (2 days)
**objective:** Tracks can be created, read, updated, and destroyed
through the Rails API.

### Phase 3: Annotations, components and highlighting (3 days)
**objective:** Annotations can be created, read, updated, and destroyed
through the Rails API. Text in a track can be assigned an annotation
when users highlight a line.

### Phase 4: Comments (1 day)
**objective:** Comments can be created, read, updated, and destroyed
through the API. Comments belong to users and either tracks or annotations.

### Phase 5: Voting (1 day)
**objective:** Votes belong to users and either annotations or comments.

### Bonus Features (TBD)
- Tag tracks by artist, style, language, or other features
- Search tracks by title
- Allow multiple contributors to an annotation
